# 🛒 E-Commerce Fraud Detection using Machine Learning  

### 🔍 Detecting Fraudulent Transactions Across Global E-Commerce Platforms  

---

# 🧠 Problem Description  

E-commerce platforms process millions of transactions daily, but a small fraction of them are **fraudulent** — involving stolen cards, fake accounts, or abnormal cross-border activity. Detecting these fraudulent transactions in real time is critical for preventing **financial losses**, maintaining **platform integrity**, and ensuring **customer trust**.  

This project develops a **machine learning system** that automatically identifies potentially fraudulent e-commerce transactions by analyzing **user behavior**, **transactional attributes**, and **geographic indicators**.  

The model uses a **synthetic yet realistic dataset** containing 300,000 transactions from 6,000 unique users across five major cities — **Istanbul, Berlin, New York, London, and Paris**. It simulates real-world fraud behaviors such as:  

- Night-time fraud spikes and daily temporal patterns  
- Cross-country card usage (different billing vs. transaction countries)  
- High-value or unusual transactions from new accounts  
- Device and channel (web/app) patterns indicating suspicious activity  

The model outputs a **fraud probability score** for each transaction.  
This score can be used by e-commerce platforms to:  

- Flag or block suspicious transactions  
- Trigger additional authentication or manual review  
- Improve risk management and loss prevention systems  

Ultimately, this project aims to create a **scalable and explainable ML-based fraud detection system** that helps e-commerce businesses reduce fraud risk while maintaining seamless user experience.
